# CSharpBinaryConverter
CSharpBinaryConverter is a C# library that serializes classes into binary format. It converts complex class structures into a flat binary representation, allowing for efficient data storage and transmission. With its easy-to-use API, CSharpBinaryConverter simplifies the process of converting C# types into binary data.

**What is a flat layout?**
A flat layout refers to a data structure or memory layout where the data is stored in a linear, non-hierarchical manner.

_**Note: When writing an object in a flat layout, if the object is null, an exception will be thrown. This is because a flat layout does not contain any additional information and cannot meaningfully store a null object.**_
